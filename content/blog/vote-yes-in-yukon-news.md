From the article:

> Sean Boots’ family welcomed their second child into their home. Days later, he received his first shipment of lawn signs on electoral reform.
> 
> Boots started the Vote Yes campaign to get the word out to Yukoners about the plebiscite ballot before electors go to cast their votes in the 2025 territorial elections.

> Boots has launched a website, bulk ordered lawn signs and made up posters to inform voters and promote his message.
> 
> “My wife has been very patient with me having an either well timed or poorly timed hobby, depending on how you put it, to also promote electoral reform as we're welcoming a new kiddo into our house,” Boots told the _News_ at the newsroom on Oct. 17. 
> 
> “A friend joked when the lawn signs arrived on Monday that our other baby arrived.”
> 
> The campaign driven by Boots is encouraging Yukoners to choose yes, the territory should move to a ranked-voting system.

> Boots compared the concept of first past the post to daylight savings time changes.
> 
> He grew up in Saskatchewan which, like the Yukon, doesn't change the clocks for daylight savings time, unlike most places in Canada.
> 
> "Once we stop using it, everyone will be like, ‘thank goodness. This new system is so much better’,” he said. 
> 
> “Provinces across Canada have talked about getting rid of daylight savings time changes forever, but only the Yukon actually did it. And I think that's something that's really cool about the territory, is that you can actually go for stuff.”
