**With less than a week before the Yukon territorial election, here‚Äôs a quick update from [Vote YES Yukon](/)!**

It‚Äôs been wonderful to see the level of community support and enthusiasm for the Vote YES Yukon campaign. People from across the Yukon are excited about the ‚Äúyes‚Äù vote and about the possibility of ranked voting. 

To everyone who has helped spread the word, helped put up lawn signs, and donated to the campaign, thanks so much for the support! And to everyone who is voting yes and letting friends and family know about the plebiscite, thanks for helping make Yukon politics more awesome. üíñ
