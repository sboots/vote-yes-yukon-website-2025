With the 2025 Yukon election campaign officially starting, we’re thrilled to launch the **[Vote YES Yukon](/)** campaign!

The [electoral reform plebiscite](https://electionsyukon.ca/en/plebiscite) taking place alongside the territorial election is a great opportunity to make Yukon politics better. And, it’s a chance to [inspire the rest of Canada](/#show-canada-that-electoral-reform-is-possible) by showing that electoral reform is possible!

Electoral reform – improving how we vote and choose our political representatives – has been talked about for years. The electoral system we use across Canada today, “first-past-the-post”, has [a lot of downsides](https://sboots.ca/2025/08/20/in-support-of-the-yukon-electoral-reform-plebiscite/#what-s-happening) that lead to more polarization and more extreme political views. 

Here in the Yukon, a [citizens’ assembly of everyday Yukoners](https://www.yukoncitizensassembly.ca/) looked at how our electoral system could be improved. After a lot of discussion, the citizens’ assembly [landed on ranked voting](https://www.yukoncitizensassembly.ca/ycaer-final-report-october-2024/) as the best option for the Yukon. 

In ranked voting, you choose your candidates in order of preference – 1, 2, 3 and so on – when you vote. It gives you more of a choice than just picking one option, and it encourages political candidates to appeal to a broader range of the Yukon population. 

At the same time, ranked voting [keeps the local responsiveness and accountability](/#create-better-political-outcomes) of our current system. It’s a win-win! 

Over the election period we’ll share more updates from the Vote YES Yukon campaign. **We’d love for you to get involved!** You can [print off a poster](/#print-off-a-poster), [donate to our lawn sign fund](/#donate-to-our-lawn-sign-fund), [request a lawn sign](/#request-a-lawn-sign), and – most of all – [tell your friends](/#tell-your-friends-to-vote-yes) about the plebiscite and encourage them to vote YES!

Thanks for reading and, as always, keep on being awesome! \
