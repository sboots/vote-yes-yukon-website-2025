Under our current voting system, the math doesn’t always math. 

Yukon’s elected representatives are often elected by a minority of voters. They don’t need a majority of votes to win – just more than anyone else. In practice, they have received as little as 30 per cent of the vote.

This territorial election, show your support for something more fair. Support the plebiscite to adopt ranked voting.

This would let you number the candidates you like in order of priority.  If you only want to support one candidate, that’s also fine!

It’s a simple, proven approach that’s used by Yukon's and Canada’s political parties to select their leaders. Our neighbours in Alaska also use it in their elections.
On November 3, vote YES to ranked voting.
