Translated from the article:

> In my opinion, voting "yes" in the plebiscite is an opportunity not to be missed. Ranked voting changes the incentives of candidates and political parties in a positive way. In the first-past-the-post system, politicians are motivated to reinforce the most emotional and extreme opinions of their political bases. In a ranked voting system, their incentives are reversed. Instead, needing to appeal to the majority of voters, even as a second or third choice, encourages collaboration and inclusivity, which is clearly absent from our current politics.

> It’s up to us, as engaged voters, to seize this opportunity to improve our political environment. I hope the “yes” option is enthusiastically supported by voters across the Yukon – and I hope the next government respects this choice and implements it for our next territorial election. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to achieve electoral reform in the Yukon. Certainly, not one to miss.
