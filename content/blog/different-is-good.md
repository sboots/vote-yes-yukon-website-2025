Earlier this week we put up **Vote YES Yukon** posters around Whitehorse, with help from [Mallory’s Postering](https://www.facebook.com/p/Mallorys-Postering-100057363471616/) (who did a fantastic job!).

One of our [poster themes](/#print-off-a-poster) is **“Different is good”**, riffing on the plebiscite question. The Yukon is different in a lot of awesome and unique ways, and ranked voting would be another awesome way to distinguish our territory from the status quo.

When the [Citizens’ Assembly on Electoral Reform](https://www.yukoncitizensassembly.ca/) completed their work, they [recommended the following plebiscite question](https://www.yukoncitizensassembly.ca/ycaer-final-report-october-2024/) be presented to Yukoners. Their recommendation was simple and straightforward:


> “Do you support the adoption of a Ranked Vote system replacing the current system? Yes or No.”

However, the question that was ultimately put forward on the plebiscite was determined [by the Government of Yukon’s executive council office](https://electionsyukon.ca/en/yukon-news-big-question-yukoners-see-electoral-reform-ballot-first-time). The [official plebiscite question](https://electionsyukon.ca/en/plebiscite) is a bit more complex than what the citizens’ assembly recommended:

> “Should the way members of the Yukon Legislative Assembly are elected be changed from the current system of first past the post to a different system of ranked vote? YES or NO.”

“Different” here can be a bit of an intimidating word, especially for voters who [haven’t heard much about the plebiscite](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukoners-unaware-of-plebiscite-in-upcoming-vote-9.6957812) so far. 

**With these “Different is good” posters, we’re trying to lean into the ways that being different makes the Yukon more awesome.** Hopefully voters on Monday agree, and vote “yes” to ranked voting and to better Yukon politics!
