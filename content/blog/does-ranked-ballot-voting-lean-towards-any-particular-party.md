Your questions: **Does the proposed ranked ballot voting system lean toward any particular party?** 

Thanks for the question!

1. The ranked ballot does a better job of electing the government that most voters want. It doesn't favour any one party, it favours voters!

2. The ranked ballot doesn’t favour a particular party. That’s up to the voters. It does reward parties for appealing to a broad range of voters. That's because a majority of voters have to be willing to vote for them. This is very different from our current voting system, where candidates are often elected by a minority of the voters.

3. The ranked ballot is not proposed by politicians! It is recommended as the best system for the Yukon by [a nonpartisan Citizens Assembly](https://www.yukoncitizensassembly.ca/) of 38 ordinary Yukoners from every community and every riding across the territory. The Citizens Assembly reported to the legislature, not the government or any party.
